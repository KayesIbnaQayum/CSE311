    One of the biggest challenge is cost. As there will be a huge data like image,
details, Messages etc, For, those we need to use firebase and hosting server and many other services. After that there may be a chance of high cost maintenance.
Second challenge will be the verification of data. We will need to check if the
data entered are reliable or not. Although Bangladesh has started digital NID
cards but to access the database will not be easy.

Third challenge is Attracting the contractors and freelancers.
Lastly, connection or providing security for online payment will be difficult.
